# README

## Overview

This repository contains code for the semi-automatic categorization of lithostratigraphic data for various regional datasets within the Po River watershed. The methodology used for this categorization is thoroughly described in the following paper: [Semi-automatic categorization of lithostratigraphic data](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10040-023-02677-8).

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into different databases, each of which contains a Jupyter Notebook responsible for preprocessing and categorizing the lithostratigraphic data. The datasets used in this repository are detailed in the referenced paper.

### Folder Structure

- `Emilia_Romagna/`

- `ISPRA/`

- `Lombardia/`

- `Piemonte/`

Each folder corresponds to a specific regional dataset within the Po River watershed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (colab)


## Data

The datasets used in this project are described in detail in the paper (https://doi.org/10.1007/s10040-023-02677-8). Ensure you have access to these datasets as they are required for running the notebooks.

## Methodology

The methodology for the semi-automatic categorization is outlined in the paper. It includes steps for:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature extraction
- Categorization using machine learning techniques

Please refer to the paper for a comprehensive explanation of the methods and algorithms used.
